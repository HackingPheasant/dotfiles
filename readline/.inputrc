# For more information on how this file works, please see the
# INITIALIZATION FILE section of the readline(3) man page

# You can re-read the inputrc file with C-x C-r.

# First, include any system-wide bindings and variable
# assignments from /etc/inputrc
$include /etc/inputrc

# do not bell on tab-completion
set bell-style none

# Allow UTF-8 input and output, instead of showing stuff like $'\0123\0456'
set meta-flag on
set input-meta on
set convert-meta off
set output-meta on

# Add a trailing slash for directories and symlinked directories
set mark-directories on
set mark-symlinked-directories on

# Do not autocomplete hidden files unless the pattern  explicitly begins with a dot
set match-hidden-files off

# Show all autocomplete results at once
set page-completions off

# If there are more than 200 possible completions for a word, ask to show them all
set completion-query-items 200

# Show extra file information when completing, like `ls -F` does
set visible-stats on

# Don't re-complete already completed text in the middle of a word
set skip-completed-text on


# All of the following map the escape sequence of the 
# value contained inside the 1st argument to the
