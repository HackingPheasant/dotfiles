# /etc/inputrc: initialization file for readline

# For more information on how this file works, please see the
# INITIALIZATION FILE section of the readline(3) man page
#

# do not bell on tab-completion
set bell-style none

# Allow UTF-8 input and output, instead of showing stuff like $'\0123\0456'
set meta-flag on
set input-meta on
set convert-meta off
set output-meta on

# Completed names which are symbolic links to directories have a slash appended.
set mark-symlinked-directories on

# Do not autocomplete hidden files unless the pattern  explicitly begins with a dot
set match-hidden-files off

# Show all autocomplete results at once
set page-completions off

# If there are more than 200 possible completions for a word, ask to show them all
set completion-query-items 200

# Show extra file information when completing, like `ls -F` does
set visible-stats on

# Be more intelligent when autocompleting by also looking at the text after
# the cursor. For example, when the current line is "cd ~/src/mozil", and
# the cursor is on the "z", pressing Tab will not autocomplete it to "cd
# ~/src/mozillail", but to "cd ~/src/mozilla". (This is supported by the
# Readline used by Bash 4.)
